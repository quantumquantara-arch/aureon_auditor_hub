# Deterministic Creativity (Auditable Definition)

Creativity can be produced without randomness.

Deterministic creativity:
- Novelty from deterministic procedures: rewrite systems, constraint solving, bounded search with deterministic ordering, compositional transforms, verification loops.

Audit requirement:
- Same input yields same output and same hash under identical code + environment constraints.

Non-requirement:
- A probabilistic toggle is not required for creativity. Randomness is not the definition of creativity.
