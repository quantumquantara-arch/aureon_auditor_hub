Deterministic Creativity (definition + test)
Creativity here means novelty generated by deterministic transformation/search, not randomness.
This repo demonstrates a minimal deterministic novelty transform:

* fixed semantic input

* deterministic transform (square of 42)

* cryptographic hash proof (SHA256)

* pass/fail against a pinned expected hash

The proof is the committed, replayable evidence in audits\latest\.
