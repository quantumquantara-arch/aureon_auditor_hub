Auditor Guide

Scope:
- Determinism: identical inputs produce identical outputs (hash-locked replay)
- DGK admissibility: invariant-preserving outputs only
- Coherence: internal consistency across artifacts
- Creativity: deterministic transformation and structured search (no randomness)

This repository is auditor-agnostic and system-independent.
