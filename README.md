###  The Future of Algorithmic Integrity

**Welcome to the Chain of Custody for Artificial Intelligence.**

**quantumquantara-arch/aureon_auditor_hub** establishes a radical new paradigm in a landscape dominated by black-box uncertainty: **Deterministic Creativity**.

We reject the assumption that novelty requires randomness. Instead, this repository proves that creativity can be the result of a rigorous, high-dimensional searchverifiable, reproducible, and mathematically admissible.

This hub serves as the **Admissibility Layer** for Aureon OS and Companion Intelligence (CI). It is not merely a log; it is a repository of **hash-locked demonstrations** and **multi-agent audit reports** that verify:
1.  **Strict Determinism:** `Input + Code = Exact Hash`. Zero deviation.
2.  **Deterministic Creativity:** Novel outputs derived via structured, non-random transformation.
3.  **Governance:** Full compliance with DGK admissibility protocols.

**Trust nothing. Verify everything.**

## Live runnable audit cell (Colab)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/quantumquantara-arch/aureon_auditor_hub/blob/main/notebooks/deterministic_audit_cell.ipynb)

Open the notebook and run the single cell. It prints the transformed output, its SHA256, and AUDIT_RESULT=PASS when correct.

## What auditors verify

1) Determinism: same input  same output  same hash  
2) Evidence-first claims: claims accepted only when backed by committed artifacts under audits/canonical/ or reproducible scripts under tools/  
3) Deterministic creativity: creative outputs can still be produced deterministically using structured transforms, constraint solving, canonicalization, and bounded search. Creativity  randomness.

## Quickstart (local)

Run the audit script:
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\run_audit.ps1

Inspect canonical evidence:
- audits/canonical/output.txt
- audits/canonical/output_hash.txt
- audits/canonical/expected_hash.txt

Audit protocol:
- docs/AUDITOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- docs/CLAIMS_AND_EVIDENCE.md
- docs/DGK_ADMISSIBILITY.md
- docs/DETERMINISTIC_CREATIVITY.md
